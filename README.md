## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Run** `SpeedClick(main).py` inside the `Code` directory using **Python 3.13**.  
   ➤ [Download Python 3.13.3 here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.3/python-3.13.3-amd64.exe)

2. Let the script run in the background in a terminal or your IDE.  
   By default, it starts in **command mode** — be careful with your keyboard inputs.

## ⌨️ Keybinds & Modes

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `S` | **Selection Mode Toggle** – Start/stop recording mouse clicks and drags. Adds to the current sequence. |
| `E` | **Execute Mode** – Run the saved selection sequence. |
| `D` | **Delete Sequence** – Clears the currently saved sequence. |
| `V` | **View Sequence** – Shows the current sequence in a popup. |
| `0–9` | **Profile Save/Load** – Save or load the current sequence to/from one of 10 profiles. |
| `N` | **Noise Mode** – Automatically move the mouse around within a predefined area. *(Optional feature you can implement)* |
| `Q` | **Quit** – Exit the program immediately and safely. |

## 📌 Notes

- Works best on the **main monitor** — clicks on other monitors may be misaligned.
- Selection mode **does not overwrite** — all clicks are added until cleared.
- Runs safely in the background, providing real-time input detection.
- GUI popups help you preview your sequences visually.
